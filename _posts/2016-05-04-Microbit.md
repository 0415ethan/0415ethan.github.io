Micro:bit

A Micro:bit is a mini computer and this allows kids to get into programing and in our ICT lesson the teacher asked us to program a Sorting Hat that tells you what house you would be in. It was quite hard but fun in the end. I learnt how to program the basics in JavaScript, including using Global Variables and Randomise.The learning outcomes is to learn to code in javascript
