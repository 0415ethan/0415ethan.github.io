Ok this is going to be a long blog so hold on

it was lots of fun to create my identity map and i think that i put in a lot of effort. As i shared my map with the rest of the class i felt good because it knew that it was good i would get good feedback from it. Now i commented on the other identity maps and i it felt ok to give people feedback because some were bad and giving constructive criticism felt ok. i did enjoy the process of making these maps because they were something i care about. i was really happy with my comments because none of them were bad and there weren't any surprises i was confident.i think the process is not very different i to when you comment online when the person writing the comment anonymously but when it isn't that it is very different. i think that i knew what to post and what not to so i don’t think that it helped me decide what to post online. based on this activity i don’t want to change any of my post on social media. my last six lesson did change the way i think about social media because i said that not all social media will be good. i plan to use social media differently by checking whether they are good or not

today's lesson was about writing comments about people's identity map and then reading the comments
