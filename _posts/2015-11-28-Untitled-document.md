So in Thursday's lesson we made our own website using Github and we used a tool called Gabriel, the markdown angel. On the website I created a title, with the date and content area. Over the coming weeks my website will grow to include new areas as we learn how to create menus and content of different types. The aim of this was to create our website and customize over the coming weeks, ill be updating my blog every week.
