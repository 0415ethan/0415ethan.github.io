In today's lesson it was all back to normal as we got back to coding with code academy on python. Today I started in lists and dictionaries and got all the way up to a day at the supermarket on 42%. I encountered some challenges like getting and not being able to type properly, spelling original wrong so the code didn't work. From this lesson I learnt the def function and used it in different activities.
