(add details to "Lesson Review")</td>

  <tr>
    <td>I learnt my following the manual and reading everything that we needed to do. In this week we were coding about apples and if we eat one what will happen next. It was fun and enjoyable. The strategy that was effective was writing what was in the manual and learning what was in the manual, I know how to write simple code on the fuze box and making it say things.</td>

  <tr>
    <td>What limited my learning? Which habits do I need to work on? </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>What limeted my learning was diverted from the lesson plan and not following the manual the habits I need to work on is helping other people and not putting my head down and concentrating </td>

  <tr>
    <td>What will I change for next time? How will I improve my learning?</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>I will change for next time is going off and trying to write my own code instead of focusing on my manual and probably getting the code wrong. I will improve learning by listening to my partner instead doing other thing that are to do with the coding</td>
