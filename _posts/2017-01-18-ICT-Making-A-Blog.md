  <tr>
    <td>Starting point:</td>
    <td>I had a blog but it was very outdated and could not function properly for what i wanted it to be for now.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Target for this lesson?</td>
    <td>To have a Github Pages Static Website</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Did I reach my target? 
(add details to "Lesson Review")</td>
    <td> Yes I reached my target because I can now post anything I want on my blog using GitHub</td>

  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>I learnt well I think that following the teacher's instructions to the letter went well rather than just guessing what we had to do in the lesson and doing it wrongly.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>What limited my learning? Which habits do I need to work on? </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>I think what limited my learning was the fact I talked a lot not about the work and should focus more on getting on with the task. The habit i need to work on is not getting stressed at the computer when it doesn't work or isn't doing what i want it to.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>What will I change for next time? How will I improve my learning?</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>I think that i will change the way my blog works so that it is easier to setup and i will improve my learning by working on the task straight away and not getting carried away with things that aren't needed</td>
