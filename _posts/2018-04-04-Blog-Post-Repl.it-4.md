**What limited my learning? Which habits do I need to work on?**

The parts that limited my learning was how the coding which was on the internet is very complicated and is very hard to understand. The habits which I need to work on is just copying the code off the internet

**What will I change for next time? How will I improve my learning?**  

I think that I am going to change asking the teacher questions which i should already know the answer to. I will improve by making my code neater and taking notes in lessons.
