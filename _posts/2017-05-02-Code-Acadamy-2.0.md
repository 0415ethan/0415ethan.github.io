Code academy 2.0

Today we were continuing with code academy and python. I am now 19 percent of the way through the whole course. Which after 2 lessons and some homework is very good. In this lesson we learnt about about Boolean and his work. There were some hard bits as we were trying to get the computer to understand sums and then assign them, true or false. There were also easy bits in what we were trying to do by working out whether the sum was true or false. Blog Post 2.0 Out.
