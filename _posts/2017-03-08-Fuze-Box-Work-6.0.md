    <td>I learnt my following the manual and reading everything that we needed to do. In this week we were coding about a game which was guess a number between 1 and 100 I never thought that just a simple game had so much coding in, about 100 lines in fact of just pure coding. The strategies that were effective just going as quick as we could   </td>
