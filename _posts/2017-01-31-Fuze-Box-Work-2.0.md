  <tr>
    <td>i learnt well but we didn't make as much progress as we should have done because the 2 fuze boxes we first picked one of them didn't work and the other fuze box it's pixels were so big we couldn't see what we were coding, but 3rd time lucky and we were coding. There was the first time where the coding was wrong but that was only once in our lesson. The strategy that was effective was keep on trying and once you will get it </td>

  <tr>
    <td>What limited my learning? Which habits do I need to work on? </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>What limited my learning was how long it took to get a working fuze box because that took a lot of time and also getting so of the coding wrong. The habit i need to work on is not being angry at people not doing things quickly.</td>

  <tr>
    <td>What will I change for next time? How will I improve my learning?</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>I will change for next time not making a fuss about things i can't control or which will slow me down. I will improve my learning by making sure that i check things throughly</td>
