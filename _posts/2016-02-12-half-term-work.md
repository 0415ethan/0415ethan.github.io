So on thursday we got our half term homework it was quite simple and did not involve a computer.

we had to make an identity map this is something that includes this

Where you live now and any places you have lived in the past (if applicable) 

 Your family 

 Your hobbies and interests 

 Your future goals regarding college studies and future career(s)

 The types of media you use, including any social media

 The types of media you will use in the future to accomplish your goals. 

 Optional things to include are: family traditions, things of cultural importance, significant       events that have impacted your life, friends, etc. 

This will be really fun and i think this is a fun homework
