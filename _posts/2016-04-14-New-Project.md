New Project 

In today's lesson we looked at some presentation software which is called Prezi. It has nothing in common to PowerPoint, i find it better. It uses a way to zoom in and out and so you follow the story. Prezi doesn't have slides and you can get the whole picture in one rather than slides. This is going to be very fun as it is way cooler than PowerPoint and has lotâ€™s of new features.
