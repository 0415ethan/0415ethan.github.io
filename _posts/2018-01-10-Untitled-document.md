IT Lesson 3

So in today's lesson we had a cover teacher rather than Mr Tansley and we were tasked to revise the functions that we have already done and to try to learn how to be able to learn how to create product codes. product codes is where you enter in a code and it gives you a discount on a single product. We have to able to learn how to make the coding behind that and get it to work if you have it.
