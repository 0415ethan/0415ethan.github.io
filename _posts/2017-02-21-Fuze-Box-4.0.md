    <td>what limited my learning was the fact that we were stupid and deleted our twice once because of me but the other time when Fraser didn't want to save the work he deleted the whole coding. The habit we need to work on is not deleting work when we shouldn't and save at all times</td>

  <tr>
    <td>I will change for next time is not to accidentally delete our work which we have worked on for quite a long time and I will improve my learning by making sure what I'm doing before I do what I'm going to do and follow the coding on the lesson</td>
