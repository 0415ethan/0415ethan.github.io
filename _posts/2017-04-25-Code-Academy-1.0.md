So today we started a new topic and you are probably wandering this is a new format just as a old blog post. This term we are going to be learning code academy especially python. Our target for this lesson is to create a account and work through of many of the lessons and streaks we could go through. We also have a new teacher in our lessons. I think that I need to improve on the fact of asking people to help and be more resilient myself. Code academy 1.0
