    <td>How did I learn? What strategies were effective?
I felt that I learnt pretty well, as i was ahead of some of the other boys, I think the strategy that was most effective was one of watching whatever the teacher did on the screen and making sure that i know what he is doing</td>

**What limited my learning? Which habits do I need to work on?**

The parts  that limited my learning was the challenge of creating something funky as homework and the challenge in the lesson. The habits which i need to work on is copying some which i don't know i have given up on

**What will I change for next time? How will I improve my learning?**

I think I will change for next time is how i am careless in my typing and take more time and care in typing. I think that i will improve as I have done the homework and created something on my own.
