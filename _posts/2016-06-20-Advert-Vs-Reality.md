Adverts can be very deceptive and with photoshop it makes them even better it was cool to see how they make things look nicer and better rather than what they actually look like. We looked at a mcdonald's and how their burger looks so different from the real burger that is actually is. They went to a food stylist and even that took 6 hours to make before it was finished and they had to get the correct photograph of the burger. That was done so they went to photoshop it and that took ages as well so the whole process took a day rather than the one you buy which is less than a minute
