We were asked to do two hours of codcademy as our half term homework. I have now completed the two hours work and this is my diary blog about it. I started off on Thursday by doing codecademy, Phython. The time flew by and I finished 28 minutes later. On Friday, I continued Phython coding and did a further 23 minutes work. At the weekend on Saturday, I coded a vacation trip, which took me 19 minutes and I was pleased with my effort, as it worked first time.  On the Sunday, I coded the vacation trip costs and expenses and it was harder, so I spent around 35 minutes doing it, making just over two hours work in total. Overall, I got up to a new chapter and am now on the Python Lists and Dictionaries.
