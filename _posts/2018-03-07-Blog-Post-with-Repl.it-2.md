<table>
  <tr>
    <td>How did I learn? What strategies were effective?
I learnt well as I learnt new things as was quicker than other people in my class. The strategies that were effective were trial and error and asking the teacher if you need help</td>

**What limited my learning? Which habits do I need to work on?**

The parts  that limited my learning was the challenge of creating writing a chatbot program as homework and being able to understand it in the lesson.  I need to work on trying to work out something on my own

**What will I change for next time? How will I improve my learning?**  

I think that I am going to change asking the teacher straight away instead of doing something independently.
