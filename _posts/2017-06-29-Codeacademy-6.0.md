In this lesson we were just trundling along with codecademy. Yes I did hit a few points where I was stuck and needed help. However there was a cover teacher not Mr Keen who is our ICT teacher for this term. I am right not on 47% of this codecademy exercise. This means that I am on Student Becomes The Teacher. Soon I will get onto the battleship game, which is at 60% I think.
