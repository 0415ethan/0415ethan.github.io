    <td>How did I learn? What strategies were effective?
I learnt well as I learnt new things as was quicker than other people in my class. The strategies were effective asking people and listening to what Mr Keen said.   </td>

**What limited my learning? Which habits do I need to work on?**

The parts  that limited my learning was the challenge actually coding my initials as it took long and was monotonous. I need to work on trying not forget key information as the lesson goes on.

**What will I change for next time? How will I improve my learning?**  

I think that I am going to change asking the teacher questions which i should already know the answer to. I will improve by making my code neater and taking notes in lesson's.
