**Computer parts**

So in thursday's lesson we looked at editing our webpage we made everything look good and made sure we got everything correct 

Here is a bit about bad things that can happen in computers and so enjoy  

**Input and output**: Input is when information is put into a computer - either by a manual device or automatically. The computer uses the input data and produces outputs which can be understood or 'read' by an output device. The computer is processing the information from one to the other.

**Virus**: This is a bad thing and can be made by a hacker which is made to corrupt all of you computer files.

**Worm**:  this is a program which replicates another program and this gets access to parts of your computer which they should not see

**Trojan**:  A trojan is a program which looks harmless but it isn't and it can do nearly everything with your data, it can delete data block data and even modify data 

**Boxnet/Zombienet**:  this is a thing that has been created by a hacker and will give you email spam 

**Malware**: this is the collective form for all of the things above and is all things bad in the computing world

**CPU **stands for a Computer Processing Unit. Is a bit of the computer that is where all the instructions are undertaken (to solve problems)  - it is like the brain of the machine.  This is the processor or microprocessor.  A CPU is in my laptop and in and computers.  CPUs are also in mobile phones, washing machines. DVD players and other machines.

**SSD** is the part of a computer that stores repeated information 

**RAM** is where you can access any part of the internet whenever you want

**HDD** is the place in the computer that involves the positing reading and writing Storage is
