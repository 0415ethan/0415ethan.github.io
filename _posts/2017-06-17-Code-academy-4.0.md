This lesson was very different to most as we were taught to make a cup of tea and to do it by thinking like a robot. For example you can't just say put the milk in afterwards, you have got to do it by saying, then put 25 ml of milk in the cup after you have put the 200 ml of boiling water and teabag in the cup. This is what happened in the first half of the lesson. In the second part of the lesson, we got a bit distracted and the class was in for a bit of questioning, I mean this by looking at life's bigger questions and what is everything and everyone in. This was met by some very strange responses and was a very hard to get your head around
