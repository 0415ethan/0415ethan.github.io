    <td>I carried on coding and got through a tricky piece even though it went wrong a couple of times. Again our fuze box didn't work the first few times but we got it going with some help from the teacher. I think that i learnt well and the strategies that were effective are to keeping trying and see if anything is wrong with the code in the manual   </td>

    <td>What limited my learning? Which habits do I need to work on? </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>What limited my learning was me wanting to know where other people were at and where people were in the manual. The habit i need to work on is being so noisy and also wanting to know where other people are in the manual  </td>

    <td>I will change the way i want to know what everyone is doing and i will make sure i'm not doing that and getting on with my work, i will improve my learning by concentrating more</td>
