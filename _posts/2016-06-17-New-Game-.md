In this week's lesson we were tasked to create our own game and my friend came up with the idea of higher or lower and the learning outcomes were to see if we could create a game and make all the variables and work out what to do. I think this will be really fun as we can see how our game works at the end. There will be a new blog on what is going to happen.
