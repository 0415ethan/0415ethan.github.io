In today's lesson we looked at what we use the internet for and here are some of the things that came up and maybe some of the dangers if you class them as that.

Social Media 

Instagram, Twitter, Facebook, Yubl,Musical.ly, Vine, Youtube,

Video Games

Fifa, Call of Duty, Slither.io, Tower Defense and Clash of Clans

Music

Spotify, Itunes, Apple Music and Vevo

Porn 

This is the second most searched thing on the internet after social media and watching porn is not bad but what is really bad is what it leads to, sexting as is sending someone and picture of you nude or asking for someone a picture of them nude and that can lead to grooming and extremism in many forms. I think the worst is when you do revenge porn and what means is if you do sexting and then break up with the person you sexted with they might do a thing which is revenge porn which is posting that picture or video on the internet
